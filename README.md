# California-WildFire-Predictionion
 This project focuses on predicting wildfire occurrences in California using satellite data. By leveraging machine learning techniques and NASA FIRMS data (MODIS, VIIRS), the model aims to forecast fire risks, improve early detection, and assist in wildfire management. It combines data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
